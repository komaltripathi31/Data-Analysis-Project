# Data-Analysis-Project
I have made a web application which analysis the required dataset and give the required result.


In this project,I had describe that how automobile industry harness data.
I am using an online dataset that have information about vehicle and after analysing it, predict the price of the vehicle.
This project is made on python language. The backend part uses machine learning and created on jupyter notebook.The frontend part uses HTML and CSS.

# Back-end Part
It will include many steps:
1. Data Wrangling
2. Exploratory Dataset Analysis
3. Data Visualization
4. Model Development
5. Model Visualization
6. Model Evaluation and Refinement

# DATA WRANGLING
It is the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex datasets, also dealing with missing values for easy access and analysis.

# EXPLORATORY DATASET ANALYSIS
It is a process of describing the data by means of statistical and visualization techniques in order to bring important aspects of that data into focus for further analysis.

# DATA VISUALIZATION
It is the graphical representation of information and data using visual elements like charts and graphs.

# MODEL EVALUATION AND REFINEMENT
It is the process in which we evaluate our ml model and give predictions.

# Front-end
In this we have used two things: HTML,CSS and Flask

I have link the mlmodel with the web page with the help of flask and pickle libraries.

So, In this we conclude that there are many columns which have greater impact on price and by entering these columns as an input we give prediction.
